OBJECTIVE
Players give gifts to each other while trying to remember
who gave what and which gift they have in front of them. If
they can’t remember, they have to bluff to avoid a penalty
point. Whoever has the lowest score at the end wins!
SETUP
GIFT SHOP
Shuffle the gift cards and deal each player a card. Players
place the card face up in front of them. Place the rest of
the cards face up in a draw pile in the middle of the table
to form the gift shop. Pay attention to which gift is in front
of each player.

HOW TO PLAY
The player who last received a gift
begins the game.
To start the game, this player draws a
new gift from the gift shop by taking
the top card from the face up draw pile
in the middle of the table. The player
shows the card (the gift) to everyone,
then places it face down in front of
them. The card back has an arrow that
indicates which direction the player
must pass the gift (to the right or to the
left). As the player passes the gift, they
identify the gift out loud, saying “I have
a nice __ for you.”
The player receiving the gift now has
two options – they can either accept the
gift or they can refuse it.

ACCEPT A GIFT
If the player receiving a gift believes the card actually has
the gift identified by the giver, they should accept the gift.
To accept, the player says “thank you” and places the card
face down above their original (“old”) gift card in front of
them.
Now the player has 2 gifts in front of them, so it’s their turn
to give a gift. However, it would be rude to re-gift a new
gift! Players give their “old” gift (the card closest to them)
and leave the “new” gift in front of them. (If this is the first
time they give a gift in the game, they will need to flip their
“old” gift card over so it’s face down before gifting it.) They
give the “old” gift to the person on their right or their left,
following the direction indicated by the arrow on the card
back.
Tip: Don’t forget to identify the gift out loud when giving
it away!
The player who receives the gift then has the choice to
accept or refuse the gift, following this same pattern. Play
continues until a player refuses a gift.
Note: Once a gift card is flipped over so it’s face down,
no player can take a peek. But it’s not a problem to
remember a few cards, right?

REFUSE A GIFT
When a player believes the gift they are given was not
correctly identified by the giver, they should refuse the
gift by saying “That’s not a ___.” (Players do not have to
correctly identify the gift after refusing it.)
Next, the player flips the card over and reveals the gift.
Whichever player is wrong (the giver or the receiver) takes
the card and places it face up in their personal discard pile
as a penalty point.
The player who receives a penalty point must draw a new
gift from the gift shop. They draw the new gift, show the
card to all players, then give the gift to the appropriate
player, following the direction indicated by the arrow on
the card back. The game continues from this point.
Note: As you never buy gifts for yourself, new gifts drawn
from the gift shop are always gifted immediately. They are
never placed in front of the player as a “new” gift.

EXAMPLE 1 - ACCEPTING A GIFT:
Tom has just received a
piano (face down) from
Anna and placed it above
his “old” gift, the guitar.
Now Tom has 2 gifts in front
of him. He must pass on his
“old” gift, the guitar, so he
flips the card over.

The arrow on the card back
tells Tom that he needs to
pass the gift on to Anna.
While placing the card
above Anna’s muffin card,
Tom says, “Anna, I have a
nice guitar for you.”

ANNA
Anna just saw the guitar before Tom flipped the card over,
so she’s confident he’s not bluffing. Anna accepts the gift
saying “thank you.” Now Anna has 2 gifts in front of her,
so she has to flip over her “old” gift, the muffin, and give
it away.

EXAMPLE 2 - REFUSING A GIFT:
Marlene just received a gift, and
is now giving Anna her “old” gift,
saying, “Anna, I have a nice hat
for you.”
But Anna doesn’t think the gift is
really a hat, so she refuses the gift
by saying “That’s not a hat!” Anna
reveals the gift card - and she’s
right, it’s not a hat, it’s the broccoli!

Marlene was wrong about the gift,
so she takes the broccoli and places
it face up in her personal discard
pile as a penalty point. Since she
received a penalty point, she has to
get a new gift from the gift shop, so
she draws a new card (a book) from
the face up pile in the middle of
the table. Since the book
is a new gift from the gift
shop, Marlene has to give
it away (instead of placing
it above her “old” gift in
front of her).
Marlene flips the book card
over so it is face down. The
arrow on the card back
indicates that she needs to
give the gift to the player
on her left, so Marlene
says to Anna “I have
a nice book for you.”
Anna accepts the gift
and places the card
above her “old” gift,
and then continues to play
by giving her “old” gift to
Tom, following the rules for
gift giving. TOM

HOW TO WIN
TIPS from the author
The game ends when one player
reaches 3 penalty points (cards
in their personal discard pile). All
players total the number of cards in
their personal discard piles; every
card counts as 1 penalty point.
Whoever has the lowest score wins
the game.
Players can also decide before the game to play multiple
rounds (as many rounds as there are players). After each
round, record each player’s score. After all rounds are
completed, total all scores. The player with the fewest
penalty points overall wins the game.
Pro Tip: If you forget what gift you have in front of you,
don’t let it show! Think of an item and try to bluff your way
through!
Special Pro Tip: If you are sure you know the item on your
gift card, pretend you’re unsure and try to get the other
players to refuse the gift so they’ll get a penalty point
when it turns out you were right!
Super Special Pro Tip: If you’re not sure what’s under the
gift card, use a double bluff: pretend you’re just trying to
sound uncertain to confuse everyone else!

 TOO SIMPLE?
To make the game more challenging, sort the cards into 2
piles according to the color of the arrow on the card back
(black or white). Then play with only one set (black arrows
or white arrows).
STILL TOO EASY?
ONLY TWO PLAYERS?
To make the game even more challenging, or to play with
only 2 players, start with 2 gift cards in a column in front of
each player. All other rules from the base game remain the
same.
Remember: “New” gifts are placed above “old” gifts. The
card at the bottom of the column is always the one that is
passed on.
